# Using the Rwanda CHAIN data collection site
A basic guide on using the CHAIN intervention site

## General layout of the site.
There are four basic areas of the site:

1. **Programs**: Where you can enter data for your organization.
2. **Partners**: A facebook of all the partners in the consortium (and some USAID employees)
3. **Mapping**: Visualizations of where everyone is working
4. **Administrative area**: Where to update your log in and contact info

## Administrative tasks
### Log in
* If you or a team member don't have an account, contact Mary de Boer or the USAID/Rwanda team.
* Enter your email address and password.
* If you haven't set your own password, the password is in an email. Search for *Account Info for USAID/Rwanda - CHAIN* in your inbox
* If you've forgotten your password, click `Reset Password` to have your password emailed to you.

### Updating your contact info
* After logging in, click on your name on the upper right corner and click `Profile`
* There, you can add your phone number, position (like 'Program Manager'), and any areas of expertise
* You can also change your password
* Click `Update` to save. You'll get an email confirmation.
* Note: you can't change your email address or organization.

## Entering program data
In the **`Program`** tab, you can add, remove, or change information on where you are working. We are collecting data on (1) where (which districts and sectors) you are working and (2) what (which interventions) you are doing in each region.

**Note: you DO NOT need to fill out all the information at once. Once you hit `Save`, your information will be saved for the next time you log in.**

### Adding data
1. Select your partner name from the `1- Implementing Partners` list. You should only have the option to choose your IP.
* Select one `2- Technical Areas / Programs` that you perform.
  * For instance, if I work on water, sanitation and hygiene, I could select 'WASH-Specific'.
  * *Note: for all the menus, you can start typing in the box and see the options that contain WASH*
* Select a specific intervention that falls under the general technical area category in `3- Interventions`.
  * For instance, I might work on 'Sanitation Marketing' within the WASH technical area.
  * ** If you want to see which interventions are in which technical area category, click the `(?)` next to interventions or technical areas**
* Select the districts where you are doing *that specific intervention* in `4 - Impelementation Areas (Districts)`
  * You will only have the option to select districts where you have already reported working. If this information is incorrect, please contact us.
  * If you are doing an intervention in the entire country, select `All Districts`, skip adding sectors, and click `Save`.
* Now select the sectors within that District where you are doing that intervention in `5- Sectors where selected intervention is active`
  * You will only have the option to add the sectors within the District you selected. For instance, if you selected 'Kicukiro', you can only choose any or all of the 10 sectors within that district.
  * If you previously added data, you will see the sectors you selected before.
  * You can select as many sectors as you need to by either selecting them from the dropdown menu or typing their name(s) and selecting from the list
  * **If you want to select all the sectors in that district, click `Include all sectors from the selected district`**. You can also select all the sectors and remove any where you *don't* work.
  * To delete any sector, click the `x` located to the right of the sector name.
  * *Note: you can start typing in the box and see the options that start with that name*
* Click `Save` to add the data to the database
* Repeat for all Districts that work on that particular program.
* Repeat the whole process for each technical area.
**Remember: if you press `Save`, you can return later to finish filling out the info.**

### Changing / removing data
Changing or deleting data is easy.
1. Repeat the steps for adding data: select the (1) partner name, (2) technical area, and (3) district.
* When you select the district, the box in `5- Sectors where selected intervention is active` will pre-populate any sector information that you added before.
* To delete/remove any sector, click the `x` located to the right of the sector name.
* To add any additional sectors, selecting them from the dropdown menu or typing their name(s) and selecting from the list
* Click `Save` to add the data to the database

### Viewing your data
* Under `List of Interventions / Implementing Mechanisms by sector`, you will see a table containing all the interventions you are doing in each sector.
* If you need to add or delete any data, see the previous section on 'Changing/removing data'.
* You can sort the data by clicking on the column name in the table. To reverse sort, click the column name again.
* You can filter the data by entering text in the `Search` box
* In `Updated Date`, you can see the date the data were added or changed.
* To see more data, click `Next` or `Previous`
